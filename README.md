üéµ Elf School of Music and Performing Arts Database

üìñ Project Overview

This project implements a relational database schema for the Elf School of Music and Performing Arts. The schema is designed to manage:

Music departments (e.g., Strings, Choir, Percussion).

Teachers and the classes they instruct.

Students and their profiles.

Enrollment records (students taking multiple classes).


The database is normalized and demonstrates One-to-One, One-to-Many, and Many-to-Many relationships with proper constraints.
